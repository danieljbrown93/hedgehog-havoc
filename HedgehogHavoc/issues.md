# Resolved Issues

- **[1]** Need a skeletal, executable game
- **[2]** Add movable hedgehog
- **[3]** Add block and make it movable by hedgehog
- **[4]** Add badger that moves towards hedgehog (no Dijkstra's yet)
- **[5]** Add immovable block
- **[6]** Add ability for badger to be caught when caught in the middle of 8 blocks

# Open Issues

- **[7]** Add Timer System, have more badgers spawn if timer expires, have timer extend if all badgers are caught
- **[8]** Add extra lives system. Have hedgehog lose life if it collides with a badger
- **[9]** Add scoring system, increasing points if badgers are caught
- **[10]** Add a pause menu
- **[11]** Add Dijkstra's Algorithm to the badgers
- **[12]** Add levels 2 and 3, make badgers faster
- **[13]** Add hole entity
- **[14]** Add levels 4 and 5
- **[15]** Add level select menu
- **[16]** Add game over screen when all lives are gone or all levels are cleared
