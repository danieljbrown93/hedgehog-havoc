# Hedgehog Havoc

**Class:** CS547 - Computer Game Design

**Java Version:** JDK 13.0.2

Welcome to Hedgehog Havoc! In this game, you play as a hedgehog and try to capture badgers by trapping them within blocks. This game is based off of Rodent's Revenge.

## Rules  
In order to win at this game, you need to capture at least 6 badgers per level. You can capture them by pushing blocks around them so they can't move. Don't get caught though!

## Controls / Cheat Codes
Once the game is running, you can pause the game by pressing Esc, which will show you a refresher on all of the controls.  
  
Pause/Resume: Esc  
Level Select: L  
God Mode: H  
Game Over: G + O  
100 Extra Lives: =  
Debug Pathfinding: D  

## Details
For path finding in this game, I used breadth first search. You can see the path from the badgers to the hedgehog by pressing the D key. It will only show a path if there is one available, and it gets a little odd looking if there are multiple badgers at a time. If there is no path to the hedgehog, the badgers enter "dumb" mode and just try to get as close as possible in the direction of the hedgehog.
